# Getting to the bottom of Bitcoin

My iPhone still runs iOS 5, a two year old operating system. My Mac, OS X 10.7, a 3 year old operating system. My view is, if it ain't broke, don't fix it â€“ especially if you don't need the fancy new features. You might as well let other people find and fix all the bugs before you go all-in.

For this reason, I've so far ignored [crypto-currencies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cryptocurrencies). The allure of getting into the bottom of a gold rush is tempting (although, unless you're talking about new currencies like [Litecoin](https://litecoin.org), that ship has probably already sailed). Although a couple of websites are now starting to accept [Bitcoin](http://bitcoin.org) payments, the currency is still little more than a toy. Annoyingly, nobody I talk to about it seems to be able to explain *why* currencies like Bitcoin are a better bet, financially, than their traditional counterparts.

So Bitcoin remains on the list of things to try once other people I trust have blazed the trail ahead of me. One of them is a chap called [mathew](http://meta.ath0.com) (to whose excellent blog I was introduced by [David](http://drj11.wordpress.com), ScraperWiki's First Engineer). He recently published a series of short posts exploring cryptocurrencies and their future. Well worth a read, even if all this digital smidgital stuff goes right over your head:
