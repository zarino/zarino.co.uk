# Getting to the bottom of Bitcoin

My iPhone still runs iOS 5, a two year old operating system. My Mac, OS X 10.7, a 3 year old operating system. My view is, if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it – especially if you don’t need the fancy new features. You might as well let other people find and fix all the bugs before you go all-in.

[![Graph showing the median value of Bitcoin to US Dollar over 2013, starting at almost 1 USD, rising to a high of 1200 USD in early December, then ending the year at 800 USD](/media/bitcoin-usd-graph.png)](/media/bitcoin-usd-graph.png)

For this reason, I’ve so far ignored [crypto-currencies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cryptocurrencies). The allure of getting into the bottom of a gold rush is tempting (although, unless you’re talking about new currencies like [Litecoin](https://litecoin.org), that ship has probably already sailed). Although a couple of websites are now starting to accept [Bitcoin](http://bitcoin.org) payments, the currency is still little more than a toy. Annoyingly, nobody I talk to about it seems to be able to explain *why* currencies like Bitcoin are a better bet, financially, than their traditional counterparts.

So Bitcoin remains on the list of things to try once other people I trust have blazed the trail ahead of me. One of them is a chap called [mathew](http://meta.ath0.com) (to whose excellent blog I was introduced by [David](http://drj11.wordpress.com), ScraperWiki’s First Engineer). He recently published a series of short posts exploring cryptocurrencies and their future, and whether you think Bitcoin’s the next green-back or just a flash in the pan, they’re well worth a read:

* [Explaining Bitcoin](http://meta.ath0.com/2013/12/19/explaining-bitcoin)
* [Bitcoin and quantitative easing](http://meta.ath0.com/2013/12/20/bitcoin-and-quantitative-easing/)
* [The future of Bitcoin](http://meta.ath0.com/2013/12/21/the-future-of-bitcoin/)
* [Bitcoin: Other dissenting voices](http://meta.ath0.com/2013/12/22/bitcoin-other-dissenting-voices/)

Also worth adding to this list, even though it’s by a different author (Nobel laureate and Princeton Economics professor Paul Krugman) is this post from the New York Times blog:

* [Bitcoin is Evil](http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/12/28/bitcoin-is-evil)

Ignore the linkbait title. His final point – that we shouldn’t immediately discount Bitcoin’s ideological value just because it’s at the centre of a ridiculous financial bubble – is a sharp one.

All very interesting. Now, if you don’t mind, I’m off to [grab some tulips…](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulip_mania)
