# Critical

The blog would be a complete failure if it didn't have:

- Single post display, showing title and post content
- List of previous posts

# Essential

The blog would be pretty useless if it didn't have:

- Posts stored as static files in version control
- Posts written in raw HTML
- 'Draft' posts hidden from view
- Site header with my name in it
- Apache rewrite rules for neat URLs
- RSS feed served with the right mime type

# Optional

Requirements that can be dropped if neccessary:

- Search by title or post content
- Display of the date when a post was made
- Write posts in Markdown as well as just HTML
- Directory for images to be stored and linked to
- Avoid manual Jekyll-like complition process
- Browse posts by category

# Nice

It would be cool if, along the way, the blog also acquired:

- Minimal, responsive design
- Server auto-refresh when new code pushed to Github repo
