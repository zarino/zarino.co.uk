  Organ donation may still be opt-in, but elsewhere in the NHS, people with far too much power and not enough common sense are pushing the button on an opt-out nightmare innocuously called “care.data”.

A while back, I wrote about [organ donation in the UK](/post/whats-in-a-checkbox), and looked with some astonishment at the discrepancy between donation rates in opt-in countries like the UK (17%) and Germany (12%) versus opt-out countries like Austria (99.98%) and France (99.91%).

[{% img alt="Graph from Johnson & Goldstein (Science, 2003) showing comparative organ donation rates in European countries" src="/media/organ-donation.png" srcset="/media/organ-donation.png 700w, /media/organ-donation@2x.png 1400w" %}](/media/organ-donation@2x.png)

Surprise, surprise: When you make an option the default, basically nobody bothers to opt out.

The UK has languished with opt-in organ donation for decades, and it’s not going to change any time soon.[^1] But elsewhere in the NHS, people with far too much power and not enough common sense are pushing the button on an **opt-out** nightmare innocuously called “care.data”.

**care.data**, for those who don’t know (which seems to be basically everyone in the UK) is a scheme whereby GP surgeries will be forced to share their previously confidential patient data with an arms-length NHS body called the “Health and Social Care Information Centre” or HSCIC.

The HSCIC will then “pseudo-anonymise” the data and sell it[^2] to, at first, medical researchers, but no doubt pretty soon after, private corporations. The data is *not* shared with other GPs, or with doctors or nurses that might treat you in hospital.[^3]

The data will include **everything your GP knows about you**, such as your entire medical history, your NHS number, date of birth, postcode and gender.

The entire system is opt-out, and the HSCIC will start asking GP surgeries for data in March 2014.[^4] Supposedly every household in England has received [a booklet about care.data](http://www.nhs.uk/NHSEngland/thenhs/records/healthrecords/Documents/NHS_Door_drop_26-11-13.pdf) – although I certainly haven’t. And even if I had, from the look of it, I would probably have pretty quickly thrown it away, because it looks and reads like total spam. This is, I can only assume, entirely by design.

Because the fact of the matter is, however admirable the NHS’s aims, care.data, as it stands, is a **horrific and dangerous failure**. A failure to communicate. A failure to follow EU data protection law.[^5] And a failure to protect citizens’ rights.[^6]

No matter what the NHS or HSCIC claim, the data they collect is in **no way anonymous**. And there are essentially **no safeguards** to stop it falling into the hands of pretty much any government or private business in the world.

[You can opt out](http://optout.care-data.info) of sharing your data with the HSCIC – but they certainly haven’t made it easy. Take a look at [optout.care-data.info](http://optout.care-data.info) for instructions.

If you’d like to know more about care.data, and why it’s so laughably insidious, check out the following links:

* Wired.co.uk’s [simple guide to Care.data](http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2014-02/07/a-simple-guide-to-care-data).
* The two official NHS web pages [[1](http://www.nhs.uk/NHSEngland/thenhs/records/healthrecords/Pages/care-data.aspx), [2](http://www.england.nhs.uk/ourwork/tsd/care-data/)] about care.data.
* A [rather amusing price list](http://www.hscic.gov.uk/media/12443/data-linkage-service-charges-2013-2014-updated/pdf/dles_service_charges__2013_14_V10_050913.pdf) for how much “personal confidential data” will cost to buy from the HSCIC (answer: roughly £10,000).
* The [HSCIC‘s page on patient confidentiality](http://www.hscic.gov.uk/patientconf).
* [care-data.info](http://care-data.info) – probably the best summary of everything you need to know, with links to opt out.
* And [MedConfidential](http://medconfidential.org) – a similar site, run by the privacy activists behind [Privacy International](https://www.privacyinternational.org) and [No2ID](http://www.no2id.net).

**Edit:** It turns out [Open Rights Group Manchester](http://manchester.openrightsgroup.org/) is organising an [event next Tuesday to discuss care.data](http://www.meetup.com/ORG-Manchester/events/164318842/) with people in the know. Excellent timing!

[^1]: See [this taskforce report](http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20130107105354/http://www.dh.gov.uk/prod_consum_dh/groups/dh_digitalassets/@dh/@en/documents/digitalasset/dh_090303.pdf) for more excuses about why opt-out organ donation supposedly isn’t suitable for England and Wales.
[^2]: When I say sell, I should point out that the data itself is ‘free’, and the HSCIC only [charges administration and access fees](http://www.hscic.gov.uk/media/12443/data-linkage-service-charges-2013-2014-updated/pdf/dles_service_charges__2013_14_V10_050913.pdf). Whatever.
[^3]: For that you’ll want to look at [Summary Care Records](http://www.nhscarerecords.nhs.uk) – the list of medications and conditions which can help doctors and nurses to diagnose and treat you in emergencies.
[^4]: GPs can, theoretically, refuse to provide the data, and [a number have](http://www.pulsetoday.co.uk/your-practice/comment/why-im-opting-patients-out-of-the-caredata-scheme/20005022.article), although in doing so they are technically breaking the law. That said, [many GPs argue](http://www.pulsetoday.co.uk/your-practice/practice-topics/it/gp-takes-unlawful-decision-to-opt-patients-out-of-caredata-programme/20005018.article) that, in complying with the Health and Social Care Act, they’re already breaking Data Protection law, and the General Medical Council’s [Duties of a Doctor](http://www.gmc-uk.org/guidance/good_medical_practice/duties_of_a_doctor.asp) guidelines. So, meh.
[^5]: I’m no lawyer, but the fact that data previously collected for GPs’ internal use, is now being co-opted for sharing with the HSCIC and their customers, without agreement from the data subject, [contravenes the second principle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_Protection_Act_1998).
[^6]: Like the [“right to respect for private and family life”](http://informationrightsandwrongs.com/2014/01/31/the-care-data-leaflet-campaign-legally-necessary/) afforded by the Article 8 of the Human Rights Act.
