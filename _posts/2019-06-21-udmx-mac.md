summary: >
  uDMX USB-to-DMX controllers are a cheap, open source way to control DMX devices from your computer. But documentation on getting them running is poor. Here’s how to get a typical uDMX interface running on a modern Mac.

[Jackie](https://twitter.com/jackie_pease) and I are currently working on a hardware project that involves receiving DMX commands from a professional lighting desk.

We were loaned a uDMX USB-to-DMX interface ([like this one](https://www.amazon.co.uk/XINFLY-Interface-Controller-Lighting-Freestyler/dp/B01MDND6U9)) by another member of [DoES Liverpool](https://doesliverpool.com), so we could test out the DMX receiver hardware that we’re building.

Professional DMX equipment tends to be quite pricey, but the uDMX is a tiny, open source alternative, that typically costs about £20.

Being open source, uDMX interfaces are _theoretically_ supported by a bunch of lighting control programs, like [QLC+](https://qlcplus.org/), [Freestyler](http://www.freestylerdmx.be/), and [OLA](https://www.openlighting.org/ola/).

_But_ if—like us—you just want to send numbers 0–255 on a few channels over DMX, then there’s no need to overcomplicate stuff with third-party software. The uDMX developers provided a commandline utility that’s great for quickly debugging DMX devices.

## Downloading the source code

Download the `udmx_1_2.tar.gz` from the [Anyma uDMX webpage](http://www.anyma.ch/research/udmx/), then double-click it to unarchive it.

You’ll notice there’s a tempting `binaries` directory, and you might try to run `binaries/commandline/uDMX` but if you’re running on an Intel Mac, you’ll get this error:

    ./uDMX: Bad CPU type in executable

I _think_ this uDMX executable was compiled on a PowerPC Mac (back in 2006), so it won’t run on an Intel Mac.

Instead, you’ll need to re-compile the binary yourself, from the C source code.

## Installing Make and GCC on your Mac

If you haven’t already, you’ll need to install the (Xcode) Command Line Developer Tools to get access to `make` and `gcc` commands. You can do this with:

    xcode-select --install

## Compiling the uDMX command for your Mac

Now head over to `sources/commandline/` in that `udmx_1_2` directory you just downloaded:

    cd udmx_1_2/sources/commandline/

You’ll notice that it has a few files in it:

* `Makefile` – imagine [gulp.js](https://gulpjs.com/) had been invented in 1976. Well, imagine no more, because that’s exactly what a [Makefile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Makefile) is. A simple way of telling the [Make compiler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_(software)) what to compile.
* `uDMX` – yet another PowerPC-compiled executable.
* `uDMX.c` – the source code we need to compile.
* `uDMX.o` – an ignorable byproduct of compilation.

One of the core concepts about how Makefiles work is that they specify files to be created. If those files already exist, then the Makefile will do nothing. So we have to delete the files that the Makefile created _last time_ before we can re-make them for our Intel CPU.

Handily, the uDMX Makefile contains a `clean` rule that deletes the two compiled files for us:

    make clean

Now you’re ready to compile a fresh executable. Just run `make` without any arguments:

    make

A second later, a new `uDMX` executable will appear in the directory, and this time it’ll _actually run_ on your Mac’s Intel processor.

## Installing `libusb` to communicate with the USB device

Before you can use a uDMX USB-to-DMX device, you’ll need to [install the libusb library](http://www.anyma.ch/libusb-compat/) so your Mac can communicate with the device.

Assuming you have [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) installed on your Mac, you can get `libusb` fairly easily via the `libusb-compat` package:

    brew install libusb-compat

## Using uDMX on the Mac command line

Now, with all that stuff installed, you’ll excitedly run `uDMX` without any arguments, and either nothing will happen or you’ll get a `Segmentation fault: 11`. Useful!

Documentation for the uDMX command is basically non-existent, so here’s what I _wish_ it printed when you ran `uDMX` without any arguments:

```
Usage: uDMX [channel] [value]

Arguments:
  channel      A number (usually 0–511) corresponding with the 
               address of the DMX device (1-512) for which the
               numeric [value] is intended.
  value        A numeric value (usually 0-255) to send.

Examples:
  uDMX 0 255   (sends value 255 to the device at DMX address 1)
  uDMX 1 0     (sends value 0 to the device at DMX address 2)
```

If you have a device like a DMX lighting controller plugged into your uDMX USB interface, and the controller’s DMX address is set to, say, `1`, then running `uDMX 0 255` would most likely turn the light on at full brightness and `uDMX 0 0` would turn the light off.

Different DMX controllers and DMX devices have their own configurations though, so you’ll need to read the manual for the device you’ve got.

Finally, if you run `uDMX` _with_ arguments, but you don’t have the uDMX USB device plugged in, you’ll get an error like:

    Could not find USB device www.anyma.ch/uDMX
    Could not find USB device "uDMX" with vid=0x16c0 pid=0x5dc

Check that you’ve got the USB interface plugged in, and that you installed `libusb` or `libusb-compat` as described above.
