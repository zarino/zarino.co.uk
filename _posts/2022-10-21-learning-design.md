title: "Learning design: resources for non-designers"
summary: >
  Every now and then, a developer, product manager, or marketing person will ask me how they can “learn design”. And I’ll have no idea where to start. Well, this post is (finally!) my attempt to answer the question.

Every now and then, a programmer, product manager, or marketing person will ask me how they can “learn design”.

It’s understandable that they think I can help. The problem is, I learned the principles of visual design through osmosis, growing up in a household with two graphic designers as parents. I learned front-end web development through a decade of experimentation, back when “web 2.0” was just becoming a thing. And I learned user research and UX design on the job, first at [ScraperWiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ScraperWiki), then at [mySociety](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MySociety).

But I appreciate “spend 20 years doing it” isn’t a very useful answer to people asking me how they learn. So here’s a list of resources that might actually help. Some of them I’ve used myself, but most are just resources I’ve seen recommended by people I trust. [YMMV!](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/YMMV)

This list is by no means exhaustive. I’ll try to keep it up to date with new resources as I discover them. If you know of something that helped _you_ learn design, and you think I should add it to this page, [drop me a line on Twitter](https://twitter.com/zarino).

## All-round guides

- [Hack Design](https://hackdesign.org/) – a free, 50-lesson, self-paced course for "hackers" learning design, that touches on everything from visual design principles, to UX research, UI design, and some basic front-end skills.
- [Ben Brignell’s archive of third party Design Principles](https://principles.design/) – the guides that other organisations use to guide their product decisions, covering ethics, accessibility, performance, user research, and everything in between.

## Visual design

- [Design for Hackers, by David Kadavy](https://archive.org/details/designforhackers0000kada) and [The Non-Designers Design Book, by Robin Williams](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/the-non-designers-design/9780133966350/) – both books explain fundamental design principles like contrast, repetition, alignment, and proximity. I’ve heard particularly good feedback about the Kadavy one.
- One of many articles about Gestalt Principles – see for example, [this Smashing Magazine summary from 2014](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/03/design-principles-visual-perception-and-the-principles-of-gestalt/).
- [Designing for the Web, by Mark Boulton](https://designingfortheweb.co.uk/)

## Usability

There are a few foundational texts here, that are well worth your time, if you don’t mind a more theoretical introduction to the way designers think:

- [The Design of Everyday Things, by Don Norman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Design_of_Everyday_Things) – the origin of the term “affordance” in design. My awesome colleague [Gareth Rees summarised the book here](https://www.garethrees.co.uk/2017/12/23/book-notes-the-design-of-everyday-things/).
- [The Inmates Are Running the Asylum, by Alan Cooper](https://archive.org/details/inmatesarerunnin00coop) – the origin of “personas” in design.
- [Designing for People, by Henry Dreyfuss](https://archive.org/details/designingforpeop00drey) – the godfather of industrial design.
- [Don’t Make Me Think, by Steve Krug](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_Make_Me_Think)

There’s a small cottage industry in Tumblr-like microblogs poking fun at poorly designed experiences online. These are two I follow in [my RSS reader](/post/investing-in-rss):

- [Grumpy Website, by Niki Tonsky](https://grumpy.website/)
- [Annoying Technology, by Manuel Grabowski and Philipp Defner](https://annoying.technology/)

## Modern web technologies

Things move fast here, so it’s hard to recommend specific resources!

- [MDN CSS guide](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS) – a bit dry, but a great intro to modern front-end web development.
- [Layout Land YouTube channel, from Jen Simmons](https://www.youtube.com/c/LayoutLand) – be aware this was released just as modern CSS features like Flex and Grid were becoming standardised, so some advice might already be out of date.
- [The Google Chrome Developers YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/GoogleChromeDevelopers) – be aware that some things they talk about aren’t standards/cross-browser compliant.
- [Google’s web.dev “Designing in the Browser” YouTube series](https://web.dev/shows/designing-in-the-browser/)

## Performance

- [MDN Web Performance reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Performance)
- [Google’s web.dev guides to performance](https://web.dev/) – just bear in mind that Google has a vested interest to push its own Chrome/Pagerank concept of performance here, and some of their ‘best practices’, [such as AMP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accelerated_Mobile_Pages), are more about consolidating Google’s monopoly than actually serving users.

## Accessibility

- [MDN introduction to Accessibility](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility)
- [Inclusive Components, by Heydon Pickering](https://inclusive-components.design/) – about a dozen examples of the considerations that go into an accessible web component. Really fascinating.
- [Cards for Humanity](https://cardsforhumanity.idean.com/) – nothing to do with that obnoxious American card game. This is a great tool for testing out your solutions against randomly selected personas.
- [GDS’s inclusive design posters](https://accessibility.blog.gov.uk/2016/09/02/dos-and-donts-on-designing-for-accessibility/)
